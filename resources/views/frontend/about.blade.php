                    <p>ClickMechanic was founded in 2012 as a simple solution to the age-old problem of getting an honest, trustworthy
                        and transparent mechanic for your car. While running a previous car parts aggregator business, Andrew found there
                        was a problem with many customers not trusting their mechanics. After further investigation and a chat with his
                        mechanic brother he realised there was just no easy way to book a trusted mechanic. He then decided to study a
                        research masters in Manchester where he devoted himself to understanding these problems better. After writing an
                        85,000 word thesis on the space he moved to London to join accelerator EF where he met Felix who had identified
                        these same problems. The pair decided to then team up and develop ClickMechanic with the goal of building the
                        easiest and most transparent way for car owners to book trusted mechanics.</p>
